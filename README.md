# Lisp-Stuff


## Mandelbrot Set Zoomer
File works with clisp, but not emacs lisp or the repl.it compiler. 
Known to work with [this](https://rextester.com/l/common_lisp_online_compiler) compiler. 

Note: Due to the nature of floating point errors, this zoomer isn't 100% accurate. Please feel free to let me know if there's any arbitrarily large floating point library for lisp and most importantly, one that tries to avoid floating point errors. For example, something like the BigDecimal datatype in Java.
